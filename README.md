Generates all the possible combination of given numerical digits 


remember to keep in mind not to exceeded the more digits value
or else it will overwrite your system storage.

in computer programming 1 numeric = 1 byte of storage
at 4 rows(box) and 5 digit numbers the 
storage calculation would be :

5×5×5×5 = ans

if numeric are 12 and box(row) is 7 then:
12×12×12×12×12×12×12 = ans

but numeric values are only 10 maximum!!
but this is important when you do with lower
set of numbers/digits.

box or row, it's same thing, we can also call it
a container.
each box/row/container is multipled by the numeric
digits amount.

suppose you generate list of [0, 7, 3, 4] numeric
value at 10 rows :
4×4×4×4×4×4×4×4×4×4=ans

the ans or answer will be the byte of data.
1024 byte = 1 kilo byte and so on, use Google.
there will also be new lines, they must also
be calculated.
